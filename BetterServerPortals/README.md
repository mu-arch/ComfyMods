## Changelog

### 1.3.0

  * Fixed for `v0.216.7` PTB patch.
  * Removed all `ZDOMan` patches as portal prefab caching logic is now in vanilla.

  * Added a `Game.ConnectPortals()` prefix-patch to ignore the vanilla call and direct into the new method above.

  * Extracted plugin config and patche into separate classes.
  * Added `manifest.json`, and `README.md`.

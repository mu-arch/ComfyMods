# ColorfulPieces

  * You can color any building piece that can be built using the Hammer using RGB or HTML color codes.
    * Coloring is very simple at the moment and will color all materials/textures on the object (to be refined later).
    * Those without the mod installed will still see the default vanilla materials/textures.

## Instructions

### Setting target color

  * In-game, press F1 to bring up the ConfigurationManager and navigate to the ColorfulPieces section.
  * Change the target color using the RGB sliders or using an HTML color code.
  * Change the target emission color factor using the slider (this affects how bright the target color will be).

### Changing piece colors

  * Hover over any building piece ***that you are the owner of*** and a prompt will appear.
  * Hit `LeftShift + R` to change the building piece color to the target color and emission factor.
  * Hit `LeftAlt + R` to clear any existing colors from the building piece.
  * Hit `LeftCtrl + R` to copy the existing color from a piece.

  - This prompt can be hidden by disabling the `showChangeRemoveColorPrompt` setting.
  - Prompt font-size can be configured with the `colorPromptFontSize` setting.

### Changing/clearing pieces in a radius

These two commands still call the same action as the hotkey and so will obey all ward permissions.

  * `/clearcolor <radius>` (in chatbox)
  * `clearcolor <radius>` (in console)
  * Clears any colors from all pieces in the specified radius from the player.

  - `/changecolor <radius>` (in chatbox)
  - `changecolor <radius>` (in console)
  - Changes the color of all pieces in the radius from the player to the currently set target color.

## Changelog

### 1.8.0

  * Reduced overall memory and cpu usage!
  * Refactored entire colorization mechanism to use a new `PieceColor` component and `PieceColorUpdater` loop.
  * Removed prefab Material caching (which created instances) and instead make use of MaterialPropertyBlocks.
  * Added configuration options to override the Piece stability highlight gradient colors.
  * Cleaned-up this README and added more instructions.

### 1.7.1

  * Fixed a bug with the `Player.TakeInput()` transpiler code blocking other inputs.

### 1.7.0

  * Standardized `PluginConfig` to match more recent mods.
  * Moved Harmony patching code into new `PlayerPatch`, `TerminalPatch` and `HudPatch` classes.
  * Terminal commands now check for `IsModEnabled` for initial add and in the commands themselves.
  * Added `manifest.json` and changed `icon.png`.
  * Modified the project file to automatically create a versioned Thunderstore package.

### 1.6.0

  * Fixed crashes related to the VPO-compatibiity introduced in v1.4.0.
    * Reverted to original-caching behaviour that uses `WearNTear` instance itself as the key tied to Awake/Destroy.
    * Moved the SaveMaterialColor/ClearMaterialColor logic to WearNTearData.
    * Added a cache for Utils.Vector3ToColor() method calls.
    * Added a cache variable for Utils.ColorToVector3() method calls.

### 1.5.2

  * Changed how hotkeys are detected from Player.TakeInput() prefix to better Player.Update() transpiler.
    * This eliminates the double hot-key firing when in debugfly mode.
  * Moved more config-related logic into PluginConfig class.
  * Moved ZDO extensions to a new ZdoExtensions class.
  * Added two new Terminal.ConsoleCommands: /clearcolor and /changecolor

  - Fixed a missing check for isModEnabled and showChangeRemoveColorPrompt flags in Hud.UpdateCrosshair() postfix.
  - Fixed a missing yield return null condition in ChangeColorsInRadiusCoroutine().

### 1.4.0

  * Use `WearNTear.m_nview.m_zdo.m_uid` as the cache key for compatibility with ValheimPerformanceOptimizations.
  * Also call `ClearWearNTearColors()` in `WearNTear.Awake()` and `WearNTear.OnDestroy()` to assist with the above.

### 1.3.0

  * Fixed `PieceEmissionColorFactor` not being copied during copy color action.
  * Renamed `LastColoredBy` to `PieceLastColoredBy` to be more consistent with other colorful mods.
  * Added an option to change the font-size for the text prompt on hover.

### 1.2.1

  * Recompiled against H&H patch.

### 1.2.0

  * Fixed for Hearth & Home update.
  * Added new action to copy the (existing) color of the hovered piece.
    * Defaults to `LeftCtrl + R`.
  * All keyboard shortcuts for actions (including set color and clear color) are now configurable.
  * Increased maximum emission factor from `0.6` to `0.8` to allow for brighter colors.
  * Added a new `LastColoredBy` long ZDO property set to the PlayerId on set or clear.

## 1.1.0

  * Fixed a memory leak causing the game to crash/freeze during a player profile save.
    * This is because we used ConditionalWeakTable to cache piece materials but the Unity docs state that
      UnityEngine.Object does not support WeakReferences.
    * Changed to a Dictionary instead and patch `WearNTear.OnDestroy()` to remove the reference.
  * Added configuration setting to hide the 'change color' and 'remove color' prompt over a ward.

## 1.0.0

  * Initial release.

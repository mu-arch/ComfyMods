# ColorfulWards

  * You can color the glow effect of any ward using RGB and HTML color codes!
  * Those without the mod installed will still see the default yellow glow.
  * **Wards will now only extend/cover its default radius (30m) on the vertical/Y axis.**
    * In the vanilla game, the range is infinite on the Y axis and the default radius on the XZ axis.
